# Smart-Locker
This project involves using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance  between the sensor and an object. When the distance is less than a certain  threshold (10cm in this case), a message is sent to a specified phone number  using the Twilio API to notify the recipient that a locker or other object has been  opened.
